# bikesharing
## Project Overview
This project involved creating a business pitch for a citi bike (bikesharing) to angel investors. To find out how this bikesharing business operates during summer in New York City, we examined citi bike data in August. The data was analyzed and cleaned up a bit, then visualizations were created to show the trends and opportunities.
